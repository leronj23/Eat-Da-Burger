# Eat-Da-Burger

This application demonstrates a simple full stack application with a front end implemented with HTML/CSS and elements from the Bootstrap framework and the backend implemented with Node.js and Express. HTML templating is done with the help of Handlebars.

The user may enter any burger name and add it to the menu. The initial burger entry is added as available on the menu and placed on the left column of the screen. The user may then eat any burger by clicking on the delete button, which moves it into the right column.
